libANN-custom
=============

A custom patch of Mount and Arya's libANN, approximate nearest 
neighbors. It's just a simple mod of the makefile for shared libs, as
well as an extra couple of function calls for searching trees without
distances (for a large speedup on some kinds of problems).

Original code is found here:
